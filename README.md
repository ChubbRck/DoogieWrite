DoogieWrite
====================

DoogieWrite is a web-based text editor by ROBYSOFT inspired by the journal-writing sequences of Doogie Howser M.D.

DoogieWrite uses vanilla Javascript in conjunction with HTML5 Local Storage to allow a user to save a single document in the web browser.

A simple PHP script is used to allow the user to download their document as a simple txt file. 

Also utilized is HTML5 Audio. :) 

Future improvements will include: various font/color choices and the ability to save your document on a remote server with a user/password combination (think Evernote or Google Keep).
